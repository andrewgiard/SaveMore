        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This page outlines how SmartSaver handles your data and ensures security while using the app.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection & Security</h2>
        <p>We do not store, collect, or share any personal information locally or on external servers. All data entered, including insurance details, is processed only within the app and is not retained after use. Users have full control over their data.</p>

        <h2>Image Scanning & OCR</h2>
        <p>The SmartSaver app allows users to scan their insurance card using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This feature is designed to extract key details like provider name, policy number, and coverage type for user convenience. All OCR processing happens directly on the userâ€™s device, and no scanned images or extracted text are stored.</p>

        <h2>Security Notice</h2>
        <p>Some mobile apps and financial institutions have built-in security policies that prevent screenshots or screen recordings of sensitive documents. If you experience any issues, please check your device's security settings or manually enter the required information.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party API Use</h2>
        <p>SmartSaver may interact with third-party services such as Zebra, Gabi, and Insurify to retrieve insurance quotes. These services handle user data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing their terms before submitting information.</p>

        <h2>User Control & Rights</h2>
        <p>Users have full control over what data they enter. The app does not retain or store user details beyond the session in which they are used. If you choose to scan your insurance card, all extracted data is only used for the immediate session and is not saved.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Rights:</strong> Under applicable privacy laws, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ Request information on how your data is used.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ Ask for correction or deletion of your information.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ Opt-out of any data processing (although we do not store data).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Compliance With Global Privacy Standards</h2>
        <p>SmartSaver follows data privacy principles that align with major global regulations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>GDPR (Europe)</strong> - We do not store or process user data.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>CCPA (California, USA)</strong> - No personal data is collected or sold.</li>
            <li>ðŸ“Œ <strong>PDPA (Singapore & Global)</strong> - No unnecessary data retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
